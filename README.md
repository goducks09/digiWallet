After taking multiple courses on front-end, back-end, and full-stack applications, I decided to try my hand at a full-stack application on my own. I wanted to create a project that could have real-world application, and I decided upon a digital wallet. With my experience using Javascript and React, I decided to use the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack to build the applicaiton.

This application uses MongoDB Atlas to store users and cards. I used Mongoose schema to easily model the data for the database, and ExpressJS for defining the routes and middleware. The front-end was built using React.

In building the application, I was able to learn new functionalities and processes. One of these was React Context.

Being my first full-stack application, I ran into roadblocks on a few occasions that required me to research and troubleshoot new concepts, such as user anuthentication and sessions. I was able to work through these issues and now have a full-stack production application deployed!
